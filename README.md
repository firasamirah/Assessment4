# 2018 Data Science Bowl
## Project Description


The objective of the project is to classify a product into the four categories Electronics, Household, Books and Clothing & Accessories, based on its description available in the e-commerce platform.

This is the classification based E-commerce text dataset for 4 categories - "Electronics", "Household", "Books" and "Clothing & Accessories", which almost cover 80% of any E-commerce website. The dataset is in ".csv" format with two columns - the first column is the class name and the second one is the datapoint of that class. The data point is the product and description from the e-commerce website.
